    <p class="text-muted">Christ Church School is a private coeducational prep school located in Mumbai, India. It is a 
      Christian school, founded in 1815, under the auspices of the Bombay Education Society. It has close to 3800 students
      , all of whom are night scholars. The school is twinned with Barnes School, in Deolali, Nashik. Both schools follow 
      the ICSE curriculum. It is located in Byculla, just ahead of the JJ flyover. The school is located on Clare Road, 
      or as it is locally called, Mirza Ghalib Marg.The parish church Christ Church, Byculla was later built on part of 
      the land given originally to the BES, and remains there to this day. Much of the original land was later sold to 
      help in the building of Barnes, which was established in 1925 as a school for boarders. The BES schools, as they 
      were popularly known, were primarily boarding schools for Anglo-Indian boys and girls, mainly belonging to the 
      Anglican Church. However, day-scholars were later admitted, and they were of all castes and creeds. In the early 
      1900s, the BES merged with the Indo British institution which had been founded by Rev. George Candy, in 1837. In 
      1925, two new schools were established - one for day-students only (Christ Church School), and one for boarders and 
      day-students (Barnes School).</p>

     <p class="text-muted">A library is a collection of books, and possibly other materials and media, that is accessible 
      for use by its members and members of allied institutions. Libraries provide physical (hard copies) or digital (soft
      copies) materials, and may be a physical location, a virtual space, or both. A library's collection normally 
      includes printed materials which may be borrowed, and usually also includes a reference section of publications 
      which may only be utilized inside the premises. Resources such as commercial releases of films, television 
      programmes, other video recordings, radio, music and audio recordings may be available in many formats. These 
      include DVDs, Blu-rays, CDs, cassettes, or other applicable formats such as microform. They may also provide access 
      to information, music or other content held on bibliographic databases.</p>

     <p class="text-muted">An auditorium is a room built to enable an audience to hear and watch performances. For movie 
      theatres, the number of auditoria (or auditoriums) is expressed as the number of screens. Auditoria can be found in 
      entertainment venues, community halls, and theaters, and may be used for rehearsal, presentation, performing arts 
      productions, or as a learning space.Sports venues such as stadiums and racetracks also have royal boxes or 
      enclosures, for example at the All England Club and Ascot Racecourse, where access is limited to royal families or 
      other distinguished personalities. In other countries, sports venues have luxury boxes, where access is open to 
      anyone who can afford tickets. Additionally, some sports venues were themselves called auditoria, such as the 
      former Buffalo Memorial Auditorium.</p>

    <p>Today, Something unexpected happened in my life, Actually It was like a surprise for me, I was completely shocked 
      when I got to know that I’ve won the first prize in my Inter School debate on environmental pollution. It was the 
      second time when I participated in debate competition. At the time when I participated for the very first time so I 
      didn’t secure any position in this competition, At that time I felt a little sad but I decided that I’d do more hard
      work and I will participate again and I guess that I took the right decision to participate again, Also I learnt 
      that hard work always pays off because At my first participation, I was not concerned towards this competition but 
      when I faced failure then It inspired me to do more hard work and because of that I have gotten this prize, My 
      parents are very proud of me and they have gifted me a cycle for my achievement and now I have known that hard work 
      is most important to achieve success.</p>

      Football championship so as we won it. I and my team are very happy today. This victory was our dream for a long

    <p>Today was a science exhibition in my school. I have also taken part in the exhibition. My group had made a model 
      of the greenhouse effect for the exhibition. We have practiced and given a lot of efforts for the exhibition. When 
      the judges came to our model, they were very happy to see our efforts. They asked many questions related to our 
      model. All the four of us gave the answers with confidence and serenity. At the end of the day when the results 
      were out, we stood first in the competition. We won first prize. It was the day which brought so much happiness to 
      us. After school, we celebrated our happiness and enjoyed a lot.</p>

    <p class="list-group-item col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">A school meal (whether it is a breakfast, lunch, or 
      evening meal) is a meal provided to students and sometimes teachers at a school, typically in the middle or 
      beginning of the school day. Countries around the world offer various kinds of school meal programs, and altogether,
      these are among the world's largest social safety nets. An estimated 380 million school children around the world 
      receive meals (or snacks or take-home rations) at their respective schools. The extent of school feeding coverage
      varies from country to country, and as of 2020, the aggregate coverage rate worldwide is estimated to be 27% (and 
      40% specifically for primary school-age children).The objectives and benefits of school meals vary. In developing 
      countries, school meals provide food security at times of crisis and help children to become healthy and productive 
      adults, thus helping to break the cycle of poverty and hunger. They can address micronutrient deficiencies by 
      serving diverse foods or including fortified foods.[4] They also serve as an incentive to send children to school 
      and continue their education, and they can be leveraged specifically to reduce barriers to schooling for girls. When
      school meals are targeted toward low-income or vulnerable children, they serve as a social safety net. Especially 
      in developed countries, school meals are structured to encourage healthy eating habits. School meal programs can 
      also be aimed at supporting the domestic or local agricultural sector.</p>

  <h4>Implemented Online Attendence Management System</h4>
  <img src="attendance.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
  <p class="list-group-item col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1. Accuracy- Humans are prone to error, even if we 
    provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance management systems ensure accurate time 
    records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry. Tis accurate data thereby helps to 
    provide accurate performance and payroll data.
    <br>
    2. Economics- Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? India still has informal 
    domestic economies; COVID-19 reversed both economic growth and poverty reduction; credit access weaknesses 
    contributed to lower private consumption and inflation; and new social and infrastructure equity efforts. Nearly 70% 
    of India's GDP is driven by domestic consumption. The country remains the world's sixth-largest consumer market.Apart 
    from private consumption, India's GDP is also fueled by government spending, investments, and exports. In 2022, India 
    was the world's 6th-largest importer and the 9th-largest exporter. India has been a member of the World Trade 
    Organization since 1 January 1995. It ranks 63rd on the Ease of doing business index and 40th on the Global 
    Competitiveness Index. Due to extreme rupee/dollar rate fluctuations India's nominal GDP fluctuates significantly. 
    With 476 million workers, the Indian labour force is the world's second-largest. India has one of the world's highest 
    number of billionaires and extreme income inequality.
    <br>
    3. Productivity/ Efficiency- Productivity is the degree to which speakers of a language use a particular grammatical 
    process, especially in word formation. It compares grammatical processes that are in frequent use to less frequently 
    used ones that tend towards lexicalization. Generally the test of productivity concerns identifying which grammatical 
    forms would be used in the coining of new words: these will tend to only be converted to other forms using productive 
    processes.The efficiency movement was a major movement in the United States, Britain and other industrial nations in 
    the early 20th century that sought to identify and eliminate waste in all areas of the economy and society, and to 
    develop and implement best practices. The concept covered mechanical, economic, social, and personal improvement. The 
    quest for efficiency promised effective, dynamic management rewarded by growth. </p>
